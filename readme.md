## Flights Dataset

> This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 2004 to 2020.


## Summary of Findings

> The variation in the average total delayed time in minutes per each year was plotted. And it shows that 2016 has the most delayed time which is more than 5000 minutes. And 2020 has the least delayed time which is around 1500 minutes.
> There is a strong positive relation between the number of flights delayed and the total delayed time, where the delay because of air carrier issue. Which inducates that when the number of flights increase, the delay time increase.
> There is a positive relation between the number of flights delayed and the total delayed time, where the delay because of weather issue.
> There is a positive relation between the number of flights delayed and the total delayed time, where the delay because of national aviation system issue.
> There is a positive relation between the number of flights delayed and the total delayed time, where the delay because of security issue.
> There is  a positive relation between the number of flights delayed and the total delayed time, where the delay because of late aircraft issue.
> The variation of the delay reasons over the years shows that the least delay was because of security issue, and the most delay was because of late aircraft issue. We can notice that the most number of cancelled flights was in 2020 and we can conclude that it was because of the covid 19 pandemic.
> The total delayed arrival time for the 100 frequentied cities show that Chicago has the most delayed time which means the most delayed number of flights. And Dallas city comes in the second position.
> The least number of flights delayed because of security issue was 0.0%, and the most number of flights delayed because of late aircraft 5.4%.
> July 2016 has the highest average delayed time for arrival.
> December 2007 has the highest number of delayed flights.
